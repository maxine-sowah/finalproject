    <p> Willow is currently facing a dilemma. She has a job interview at a big company tomorrow. However, she is not sure if she should wear out her natural hair or straighten it. One of her friends, who currently work there told her that straightening her hair would most likely give her a better chance of actually getting the job. Willow doesn't know what to do because she has always rocked her curls but she needs the job and doesn't want to come off as "unprofessional". What should Willow do?  </p>
