    <h1>Willow decides to straighten her hair</h1>
    <p>Willow reluctantly decides to flat iron her hair much to her dismay. She goes to her interview, but she feels uncomfortable the entire time because she is not used to this new look and doesn't feel like herself. Fortunately, she does get the job, but has to waste money to get her hair straightened every two weeks or so, which has been extremely damaging to her hair, but at least she got the job, right?  </p>
