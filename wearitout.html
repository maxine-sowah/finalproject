    <h1>Willow decides to wear her hair out, but...</h1>
    <p>Willow chooses to ignore her friend and take the risk by wearing her hair out in its natural state. She goes to the interview and it goes well, but the employer makes a comment about how "unprofessional" looks and it would be best if she could "tame" it when she's at work to keep up with the company's "image". Willow is offended and is conflicted on whether or not she wants to accept the job offer or not. However, she is leaning towards rejecting it.</p>

    <p>Willow believes that she shouldn't have to work in a place where hair discrimination is allowed. Unfortunately, this is the reality for most Black women and men in America who experience this everyday. Black women in the workplace are constantly forced to conform to what the workplace wants when it comes to hair which is straight hair, something we don't have. </p>
